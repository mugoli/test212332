    <h1>Journalism</h1>
    <p>
      I spent 4 years as an editor at Apple News, where I helped curate the best of local, national, and international journalism for millions of Canadian readers in English and French. I also oversaw the curation of three weekly newsletters, and led the editorial programming for major cultural moments. 
      <br><br>A skilled moderator and interviewer, I’ve hosted live conversations with figures such as Sophie Grégoire Trudeau and Maestro Fresh Wes for corporate audiences.
<br><br>Prior to joining Apple, I worked as a broadcast and print reporter for The Globe and Mail, CBC/Radio-Canada, and more. My magazine feature writing has earned a Canadian Church Press Award, and an honourable mention at the National Magazine Awards. I'm also a former National Magazine Awards and Digital Publishing Awards juror.
