    <h1>I've been going through some things...</h1>
    <p>
      I’m combining 8 years of experience working across Canadian media and Big Tech to think about the future of journalism and information. I’m concerned with retention; more specifically, whether news – which is, at its core, storytelling – still has the ability to <i>move</i> people; change their views, beliefs, actions, and lives.
<br><br>Despair and nostalgia have become crutches for young people living without clear and compelling futures ahead. New mediums and media approaches may have the power to inform audiences, restore critical thinking, spark creativity, and nurture hope amid the compounding crises of our times.
<br><br>I want to contribute to journalism, technology, and new media projects working in this direction. Or build them myself.
